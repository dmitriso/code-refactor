## Refactoring notes

    For this assignment my task was to refactor the given codebase for proper accessiblity standards. Upon reviewing the code many changes were made to provide better semantic html structuring. All elements were changed to ensure logical independence from styling and positioning.Accessible alt attributes were added to all image elements. The heading attributes are now presented in sequential order and a befitting title for the webpage has been given.
